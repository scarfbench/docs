# Benchmark

Scarf is a benchmark suite for evaluating agentic transformation of Java applications across frameworks: Jakarta EE, Quarkus, and Spring. This suite enables systematic assessment of AI agents' ability to migrate enterprise Java applications while preserving functionality, idiomatic patterns, and architectural integrity across different runtime environments.

This benchmark contains self-contained applications demonstrating core Java EE functionalities and their framework-specific implementations. Each example has been manually converted and verified across all target frameworks, with smoke tests included to verify application behavior after transformation.

The benchmark includes two types of examples:

1. **Focused examples** - Application examples organized per layer, where each example demonstrates a specific technology within that layer (e.g., persistence, presentation, integration).
2. **Whole applications** - Complete, functioning applications that demonstrate the coordination and interaction between multiple layers.

### Examples

#### Focused Examples

Application examples organized per layer, where each example demonstrates a specific technology within that layer (e.g., persistence, presentation, integration).
